                <h2>What is Vibe Coding?</h2>
                <p>Vibe coding is a revolutionary programming technique that uses AI to build software via text prompts. Rather than writing traditional code, vibe coders communicate their intentions in natural language, using AI programs like Claude, ChatGPT, or Gemini to create games, simulations, web pages, and applications.</p>

                <p>This approach represents a fundamental shift from syntax-focused programming to intent-focused development, where the barrier between having an idea and implementing it virtually disappears.</p>

                <h2>Riley's Vibe Coding Philosophy</h2>
                <p>Riley Brown describes vibe coding as "an accessible way to build software with AI." His approach emphasizes that anyone can become a developer by learning to communicate effectively with AI systems, regardless of their traditional programming background.</p>

                <p>Through his comprehensive tutorials and educational content, Riley demonstrates how vibe coding can make app development as simple and intuitive as using creative tools like Canva for graphic design.</p>

            <section class="tools">
                <h2>Essential Tools & Platforms</h2>
                <p><strong>Cursor:</strong> Riley's 250-minute comprehensive guide covers Cursor extensively, showing how to use this AI-powered code editor for complete project development. His tutorial includes four full projects and covers all the vibe code basics.</p>

                <p><strong>Claude & ChatGPT:</strong> Primary AI assistants for translating natural language descriptions into functional code, handling everything from simple scripts to complex application logic.</p>

                <p><strong>AI Development Environments:</strong> Modern tools that integrate AI assistance directly into the development process, enabling real-time collaboration between human intent and machine implementation.</p>

                <h2>Democratizing Development</h2>
                <p>Riley's work in vibe coding education has helped thousands of people transition from content creation to software development. His teaching shows how the traditional barriers to programming—learning syntax, understanding complex frameworks, debugging intricate code—can be largely bypassed through effective AI collaboration.</p>

                <p>This democratization means that domain experts, creative professionals, and entrepreneurs can directly implement their ideas without years of traditional programming education.</p>

            <section class="future">
                <h2>The Evolution of Vibe Coding</h2>
                <p>Riley predicts that vibe coding will continue evolving toward more sophisticated AI agents that can handle increasingly complex development tasks. He envisions AI systems that can learn from the best practices of professional developers and apply those patterns to user prompts.</p>

                <p>This evolution points toward a future where the distinction between "technical" and "non-technical" people becomes less relevant, as AI handles the implementation details while humans focus on creativity, problem-solving, and user experience design.</p>

            <section class="learning">
                <h2>Getting Started</h2>
                <p>Riley's approach to teaching vibe coding emphasizes hands-on practice with real projects. His comprehensive tutorials don't just explain concepts—they walk learners through complete development cycles, from initial idea to functional application.</p>

                <p>His "Six Steps to Master AI" framework and detailed Cursor tutorials provide structured pathways for people to develop their vibe coding skills systematically, building confidence through successful project completion.</p>
